# John Smith

I use Python for practical automation, data analysis and small tools on Linux Mint.  
I am actively building my skills and open to junior roles where I can contribute to real projects and keep improving my code quality.

## Selected projects

- **[pdf-image-tools](https://github.com/BARRYSMITH89/pdf-image-tools)**  
  Small collection of Python command-line tools for compressing images, converting between JPG/PNG/PDF, and splitting, merging or rotating PDFs.

- **[thesis-models](https://github.com/BARRYSMITH89/thesis-models)**  
  Python code for ESG–CFP panel-data analysis used in my PhD thesis on the global hospitality and hotel sector, with a requirements file and example outputs.

- **[tob-screen-automation](https://github.com/BARRYSMITH89/tob-screen-automation)**  
  Reconstructed Raspberry Pi scripts for Taste of Belgium’s in-store digital signage screen, including cloud-mounted storage and a rotated, looping video playlist.

## Tech

- Python: scripting, simple CLIs, file processing, basic plotting (pandas, matplotlib).
- Linux Mint: daily driver; comfortable with terminal work, package management and basic troubleshooting.
- Git & GitHub: local commits, branches, pushing to remotes, writing READMEs.
- Other tools: basic shell scripting, `rclone`, Raspberry Pi setup and simple automation.
