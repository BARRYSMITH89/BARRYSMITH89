- Hi, my name is John Smith.  
- I am currently learning Python and using it on small, practical projects.  
- I would describe myself as a motivated beginner, moving towards intermediate level through self-study and online resources.  
- So far I have completed one automation project and the anaylses for my Ph.D. and I am now focusing on writing cleaner code and building more complex tools.
